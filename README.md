## üîß Open Source Projects

Here are a couple open-source projects I‚Äôve worked on:

- **[Image recognizer](https://github.com/ebridges/minimal-neural-network)**: This project provided an opportunity to learn how a neural network is trained. Implemented in C with no external dependencies, it builds a network and trains it using forward & backward propagation, and then does prediction using forward propagation.  It also provides a way to export the model to be used in a graphical UI to use it.

- **[elektrum](https://github.com/ebridges/elektrum)**: This is a media management project -- think: your own Google Photos -- implemented in Python & Javascript. Dynamically organizes photos by date, etc. This includes automated AWS infrastructure using Ansible.
  - Related projects
      - **[lgw](https://github.com/ebridges/lgw)**: Simplifies deploying an application as an AWS Lambda behind an API Gateway.
      - **[metadata-processor](https://github.com/ebridges/metadata-processor)**: Processes images to extract metadata for storage & searching.
      - **[thumbnailer](https://github.com/ebridges/thumbnailer)**: Efficiently scales images into thumbnails.
